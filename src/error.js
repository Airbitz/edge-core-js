/*
 * These are errors the core knows about.
 *
 * The GUI should handle these errors in an "intelligent" way, such as by
 * displaying a localized error message or asking the user for more info.
 * All these errors have a `type` field, which the GUI can use to select
 * the appropriate response.
 *
 * Other errors are possible, of course, since the Javascript language
 * itself can generate exceptions. Those errors won't have a `type` field,
 * and the GUI should just show them with a stack trace & generic message,
 * since the program has basically crashed at that point.
